	<h2>$ Donate!</h2>
	
	It's a little-known Fun Factâ„¢ that we pay Meetup.com $180 per year to list
	our organization. We're not special; every organization on there with more
	than 50 members pays the same high price.

	<p>Throw in beer, soft drinks, chips, and pizza, and pretty soon we're
	talking real money.

	<p>Help an organizer out:
	
	<p><ul>
		<li><a href="https://paypal.me/beejjorgensen">Donate on PayPal</a>! (Brian Hall is the same person as Beej Jorgensen, for the record)
		<li><a href="https://secure.meetup.com/bendhackersguild/contribute/">Donate on Meetup</a>; <i>Meetup takes a huge cut of this donation! <a href="https://paypal.me/beejjorgensen">Paypal preferred</a>!</i>
		<li>Or donate cash in person. Most meetups have a tip jar.
	</ul>

	<p>Thanks! :)
